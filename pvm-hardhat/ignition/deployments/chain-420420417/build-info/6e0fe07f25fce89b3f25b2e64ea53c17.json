Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```solidity\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```solidity\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}\n to enforce additional security measures for this role."

To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC-20\n applications."

This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules} to enforce additional security measures for this role.\",\"errors\":{\"AccessControlBadConfirmation()\":[{\"details\":\"The caller of a function is not the expected one.

For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`). Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the default value returned by this function, unless it's overridden.

Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/MyToken.sol\":\"MyToken\"},\"evmVersion\":\"cancun\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x1a6b4f6b7798ab80929d491b89d5427a9b3338c0fd1acd0ba325f69c6f1646af\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7bb7f346c12a14dc622bc105ce3c47202fbc89f4b153a28a63bb68193297330c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmagwF8P3bUBXwdo159ueEnY9dLSvEWwK24kk2op58egwG\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/IAccessControl.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xbff9f59c84e5337689161ce7641c0ef8e872d6a7536fbc1f5133f128887aba3c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b308f882e796f7b79c9502deacb0a62983035c6f6f4e962b319ba6a1f4a77d3d\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmaWCW7ahEQqFjwhSUhV7Ae7WhfNvzSpE7DQ58hvEooqPL\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x19fdfb0f3b89a230e7dbd1cf416f1a6b531a3ee5db4da483f946320fc74afc0e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3490d794728f5bfecb46820431adaff71ba374141545ec20b650bb60353fac23\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPsfxjVpMcZbpE7BH93DzTpEaktESigEw4SmDzkXuJ4WR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x86b7b71a6aedefdad89b607378eeab1dcc5389b9ea7d17346d08af01d7190994\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://1dc2db8d94a21eac8efe03adf574c419b08536409b416057a2b5b95cb772c43c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZfqJCKVU1ScuX2A7s8WZdQEaikwJbDH5JBrBdKTUT4Gu\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x74ed01eb66b923d0d0cfe3be84604ac04b76482a55f9dd655e1ef4d367f95bc2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5282825a626cfe924e504274b864a652b0023591fa66f06a067b25b51ba9b303\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeCfPykghhMc81VJTrHTC7sF6CRvaA1FXVq2pJhwYp1dV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x2659248df25e34000ed214b3dc8da2160bc39874c992b477d9e2b1b3283dc073\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c345af1b0e7ea28d1216d6a04ab28f5534a5229b9edf9ca3cd0e84950ae58d26\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmY63jtSrYpLRe8Gj1ep2vMDCKxGNNG3hnNVKBVnrs2nmA\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd6fa4088198f04eef10c5bce8a2f4d60554b7ec4b987f684393c01bf79b94d9f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f95ee0bbd4dd3ac730d066ba3e785ded4565e890dbec2fa7d3b9fe3bad9d0d6e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSLr6bHkPFWT7ntj34jmwfyskpwo97T9jZUrk5sz3sdtR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Pausable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xdb484371dfbb848cb6f5d70464e9ac9b2900e4164ead76bbce4fef0b44bcc68f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f9d6f6f6600a2bec622f699081b58350873b5e63ce05464d17d674a290bb8a7c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQKVzSQY1PM3Bid4QhgVVZyx6B4Jx7XgaQzLKHj38vJz8\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x2d9dc2fe26180f74c11c13663647d38e259e45f95eb88f57b61d2160b0109d3e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://81233d1f98060113d9922180bb0f14f8335856fe9f339134b09335e9f678c377\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmWh6R35SarhAn4z2wH8SU456jJSYL2FgucfTFgbHJJN4E\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8891738ffe910f0cf2da09566928589bf5d63f4524dd734fd9cedbac3274dd5c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://971f954442df5c2ef5b5ebf1eb245d7105d9fbacc7386ee5c796df1d45b21617\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmadRjHbkicwqwwh61raUEapaVEtaLMcYbQZWs9gUkgj3u\"]},\"contracts/MyToken.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x867761751b86a9427d5c09131e04e9542425b52848721e53e17feca8142c453e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://610524dfcb1ce6b8045fc40a9a427f240fe21a5cd729571a8f41ac25c0653d80\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmchn3XEUBPfHF5QbU9GDMj7mfJ84DTCCnJ1EuBTLUbeoP\"]}},\"version\":1}",
